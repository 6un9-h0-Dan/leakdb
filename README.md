# LeakDB

LeakDB is a cost effective bring-your-own-data tool set to normalize, deduplicate, index, sort, and search leaked databases. Once curated, LeakDB can search terabytes of data in less than a tenth of a second. LeakDB exposes a simple JSON API, which can be queried using the command line client or any http client.
